The three tools not covered in the documentation are:
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/): It's a Python API used for writing Web Applications. A web developer can use it to write Web applications in Python without worrying about the low level implementations such as protocols, threading etc. One major advantage of Flask over Django(a Python based Web framework) is that it requires less base code and offers more flexibility than Django.
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/): Django is a Python based Web Framework. It has inbuilt features for a lot of stuff commonly used, like database management, user authentication etc, which enables a Web Developer to rapidly create Web Applications. It is less flexible compared to Flask because of these features
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/): It's a JavaScript based Web Framework mainly used to develop Single Page Applications. A Web Developer can use it to quickly design small Web applications as it allows us to use components to speed up development.
